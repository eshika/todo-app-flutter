# CS 279 Programming HW2

This repo contains the code for a basic To Do App website made with Flutter. The main code can be found in the lib/main.dart file.

On this To Do App website, users can create and check off tasks which are added to a To Do List. This site also has the additional functionality of being able to reorder the tasks in the list using drag and drop.

The final site can be accessed here: https://eshika-todo-app-flutter.herokuapp.com/#/
